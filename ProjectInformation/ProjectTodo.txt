Big things:

add ShouldReturn bool to:
    action:
	cons,listop, plus, and, or, mult, equalto, gt, lt, gte, lte, ident, minus, div 

    stmt:
	Ident, quote, numlit

    stmt_list:
	Recursive call: as value

When to add semis:
     sometimes if shouldReturn is true and were at the "end of the line" with actions put the ";\n"
